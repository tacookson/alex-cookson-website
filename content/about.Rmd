Hi! I'm Alex. I love data science, cycling, and cats.

I currently work at the [Royal Canadian Mint](https://www.mint.ca/), where I help the marketing team make the most of their data. I've worked on many machine learning and business analytics projects, including predictive models for customer churn, recommendation engines, and self-service dashboards.

I have Master's degrees in International Business from HEC Paris and Queen's University. I also earned my Bachelor's degree from Queen's University, where I studied commerce.

Feel free to look at my [posts](/post/), check me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexcookson), or admire my cats, Tom Tom and Ruby:

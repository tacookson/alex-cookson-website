<p>In this post, I create a heat map using the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-03">Philly Parking Tickets</a> dataset from <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">TidyTuesday</a>. TidyTuesday a project that shares a new dataset each week to give R users a way to apply and practice their skills.</p>
<p>Specifically, we’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning and aggregating the data that will go into our heat map</li>
<li>Creating a basic heat map</li>
<li>Tweaking <code>ggplot2</code> theme components to get a much prettier heat map<br />
 </li>
</ul>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>We’ll load a few packages in addition to the <code>tidyverse</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lubridate</code> to work with dates and times</li>
<li><code>extrafont</code> to change the font on our graphs</li>
<li><code>scales</code> to easily change number formats (e.g., 0.32 becomes 32%)</li>
<li><code>viridis</code> as a nice alternative to default <code>ggplot2</code> colours</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_observation">unit of observation</a> is a parking ticket, and we have over 1.2 million of them. I also see three categories of data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Ticket</strong>: the basics of the ticket, like what it was for, the fine amount, and who issued it</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: when it was issued. This dataset has tickets for 2017 only.</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: where it was issued.<br />
 </li>
</ol>
<p>Which are the most common violations?</p>

<p>“METER EXPIRED” and “METER EXPIRED CC” are the two most common. Is there any difference between them? Other violations seem the same, too, except for that “CC” at the end. Let’s use a cool trick to look at a couple of them: if we group by <code>violation_desc</code>, we can then use the <code>sample_n</code> function to get random observations from each group. It’s handy for spot-checking or investigating weird values like these.</p>

<p>It looks like the main difference is the <code>fine</code> amount, but “PARKING PROHIBITED” (with its slightly different spelling) has a different <code>issuing_agency</code>. Some quick research makes me <em>think</em> that CC stands for “City Centre”. That would jive with the higher fine amounts – higher fines for violations downtown.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have location data, so we can check this hypothesis. We’re going to graph a crude map using longitude and latitude coordinates for each violation type (with CC vs. without CC) and see if the result are consistent with “CC” meaning “City Centre”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tickets_raw %&gt;%
  filter(str_detect(violation_desc, &quot;METER EXPIRED&quot;),
         # Exclude outlier longitude values
         lon &gt; -75.5) %&gt;%
  group_by(violation_desc) %&gt;%
  # Only take 1000 observations -- more takes longer to plot
  sample_n(1e4) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat, col = violation_desc)) +
  # Shape of . is small, so it alleviates overplotting
  geom_point(shape = &quot;.&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Bingo! That concentration of blue dots looks like a city centre to me. I think we’ve got a good enough feel for our data to decide what we want to do with it.<br />

<div id="research-question" class="section level2">
<h2>Research question</h2>
<p>I’m sure everyone has parked somewhere they shouldn’t have. Whenever I’ve done that, I always worry: “Will I get away with it?” If I parked illegaly late at night on a Sunday, I’d be less worried about getting a ticket than if I parked illegaly on a Tuesday afternoon. Would I be right to be less worried? Let’s <strong>visualize the relationship between time and tickets with a heat map</strong> to find out. Specifically, let’s look at day of the week and time of the day.<br />

</div>
<div id="data-cleaning-and-preparation" class="section level2">
<h2>Data cleaning and preparation</h2>
<p>We’re going to perform four cleaning steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Remove “CC” from <code>violation_desc</code>. We’ll consider violations the same, regardless of whether they were in the city centre or not.</li>
<li>Correct some short-form spellings in <code>violation_desc</code>. For example we’ll add the “E” back into “PASSENGR”.</li>
<li>Derive day-of-week and hour-of-day from <code>issue_datetime</code>. We need these to be the nodes of our heat map.</li>
<li>Ditch <code>fine</code>, <code>issuing_agency</code>, and location data. We won’t be using these.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>tickets &lt;- tickets_raw %&gt;%

<p>It’s a simple dataset, but it’s all we need for a heat map.<br />
 </p>
</div>
<div id="visualizing" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualizing</h2>
<p>People generally use the <code>geom_tile</code> function to create heat maps. After specifying our x and y dimensions (day-of-week and hour-of-day) we need to specify what represents the “heat”. In our case, the heat is number of tickets for a given hour of a given day of the week.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tickets %&gt;%
  count(day_of_week, issue_hour) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = issue_hour, fill = n)) +
  geom_tile()</code></pre>

<p>It’s pretty cool we can get a heat map with a few lines of code, but it looks rough and incomplete. We’re going to make a bunch of changes to get something more polished:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add light borders to each node to distinguish them more easily</li>
<li>Add more frequent labels for hours</li>
<li>Turn the integer hour into a more recognizable time (e.g., 20 becomes 20:00)</li>
<li>Change the colour – lighter should mean fewer tickets and darker should mean more tickets</li>
<li>Make the numbers in the scale prettier</li>
<li>Change the aspect ratio – the default nodes are too wide</li>
<li>Add a descriptive title</li>
<li>Get rid of labels for the x and y axes – I don’t need a label to know that “Mon” and “Tue” mean day of the week</li>
<li>Change the fill label from “n” to something more descriptive</li>
<li>Change the font – you’ll need the <code>extrafont</code> package for anything but the most basic fonts (it requires a totally-worth-it <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extrafont/README.html">one-time setup step</a>)</li>
<li>Get rid of gridlines – we already have borders on our nodes</li>
<li>Get rid of the border around the heat map</li>
<li>Adjust the x and y axes text sizes</li>
<li>Get rid of axis ticks on the x-axis (we’ll keep the ones on the y-axis)</li>

<p>That looks pretty good! We can make a few immediate observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most tickets are issued on weekdays during the day</li>
<li>Sunday is the least-ticketed day</li>
<li>Some tickets are issued late at night on party nights (Thu, Fri, Sat), but not other nights<br />
 </li>
</ul>
<p>This heat map includes all violations, regardless of what type they are. <strong>What if we look at violation types individually?</strong> We can still use a heat map, but break it into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple">small multiples</a> to allow for easy comparison. Let’s look at the five violations that racked up the most tickets. First, though, we need to do two extra steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the <code>complete</code> function to turn <em>implicit</em> missing values into <em>explicit</em> missing values. For example, if a given violation type doesn’t have any tickets for 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday, that will show up as “NA” (missing). We want it to show up as “0” instead, otherwise our heat map won’t graph properly.</li>
<li>Look at <em>percent</em> of tickets issued within each type instead of <em>number</em> of tickets so that everything is on the same scale. If we looked at number of tickets, we couldn’t compare across types because types with the most tickets would automatically be darker.</li>
</ol>

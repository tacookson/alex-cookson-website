<p>In this post, we’re going to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a dataset of fictional character personalities.</p>
<p>PCA is a common technique for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction">dimensionality reduction</a>, which you might want to do if you are, say, trying to put together a classification model and you have a dataset with <em>a lot</em> of variables.</p>
<p>The dataset we’re using is of crowdsourced scores of personality traits for 800 fictional characters from books/movies/TV shows like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, and <em>The Lion King</em>. The data comes from the <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/">Open-Source Psychometrics Project</a>’s online <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/">“Which Character” personality quiz</a>. You can learn more about that <a href="https://github.com/tacookson/data/tree/master/fictional-character-personalities">here</a>.<br />

<p>The main fields we’re interested in are <code>spectrum_low</code>, <code>spectrum_high</code>, and <code>mean</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spectrum fields tell us what trait is on each end of the spectrum being considered</li>
<li><code>mean</code> is a score (from -50 to +50), where a score closer to -50 means the character is more like the <code>spectrum_low</code> trait and a score closer to +50 means the character is more like the <code>spectrum_high</code> trait</li>
</ul>
<p>If we look at some of Captain Picard’s strongest traits – that is, close to -50 or +50 – we see that he is <strong>charming</strong> and <strong>intellectual</strong> (low scores corresponding to <code>spectrum_low</code>), as well as <strong>bold</strong> and <strong>tasteful</strong> (high scores corresponding to <code>spectrum_high</code>). That rings true to me. I would certainly use those words to describe our dear Captain.</p>
<p>Most of the other fields are to identify who the character is and what fictional world they come from. We also have the number of ratings (<code>ratings</code>) and standard deviation (<code>sd</code>) for that character-spectrum combination. And finally, we have a helper column, <code>is_emoji</code> that tells us if the traits on each end of the spectrum are emojis instead of words.</p>
<p>Juuuust to make sure this data checks out – and because I’m really curious – let’s look at some more examples from <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and <em>The Lion King</em>. We’ll look each character’s eight strongest traits. I’ve included the trait on the opposite end of the spectrum in parentheses for reference.<br />

<p>Some traits are pretty flippant, like Elizabeth Bennet’s top trait, “treasure”, which has “trash” at the other end of the spectrum. Keep in mind that this data is from an online quiz, not a rigorous scientific study – it’s just a bit of fun!</p>
<p>The traits for the rest of the characters are spot-on: <strong>selfish</strong> George Wickham, <strong>kind</strong> Jane, <strong>foolish</strong> Lydia, <strong>awkward</strong> Mr. Collins, and <strong>rich</strong> and <strong>reserved</strong> Mr. Darcy.<br />

<p>Scar has great traits for a villain (including the very on-the-nose <strong>villainous</strong>!). Timon is <strong>thin</strong> and Pumbaa is <strong>thick</strong>. And Nala’s top trait is <strong>beautiful</strong>, which I find a bit weird for an animated lion. (In fact, it gives some hints at how characters of different genders are portrayed and perceived in media, something I plan to analyze more in a future post.)<br />

<h2>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2>
<p>Now that we have a sense of the data, let’s get into principal component analysis. There are some great resources out there already, like Julia Silge’s <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/best-hip-hop/">PCA walkthrough using hip hop songs</a> to see how it can be applied, <a href="https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/step_pca.html"><code>tidymodels</code> documentation</a> to see how <code>tidymodels</code> approaches PCA, and StatQuest’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ">step-by-step guide to PCA</a> to understand some of the underlying mathematics.<br />
 </p>
<div id="helper-datasets" class="section level3">
<h3>Helper datasets</h3>
<p>Before we get started, let’s create create some helper datasets that will help us down the line. Why? We’ll be conducting PCA with just code fields to identify characters and spectrums. Once the PCA is done, we’ll want to inspect the results and it’s not very informative to see character “HP/2” or spectrum “BAP209”. Instead, we want to see “Harry Potter” or “city-slicker to country-bumpkin”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>character_list &lt;- personalities %&gt;%

<div id="pca-with-tidymodels" class="section level3">
<h3>PCA with <code>tidymodels</code></h3>
<p><code>tidymodels</code> makes PCA <em>very</em> straightforward – in this case, it takes about 10 lines of code to set up the data properly and run the PCA.</p>
<p>First, let’s convert our data to a format that’s closer to a matrix than a dataframe. We want each row to correspond to a character and each column to correspond to a spectrum. We’ll also have a special column with <code>character_code</code> so that we know who’s who once we’re done!</p>
<p>This is what the data we’re feeding into <code>tidymodels</code> looks like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pca_data &lt;- personalities %&gt;%
  filter(!is_emoji) %&gt;%
  select(character_code, spectrum, mean) %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(names_from = spectrum, values_from = mean)

<p>Second, we’ll create a recipe that specifies <code>character_code</code> as the <code>id</code> column, normalizes the scores (this is <em>very</em> important in PCA), and runs the PCA itself.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Write recipe for PCA
pca_recipe &lt;- recipe(~ ., data = pca_data) %&gt;%
  # Specify character_code as key/id column
  update_role(character_code, new_role = &quot;id&quot;) %&gt;%
  # Normalize sets mean to zero and standard deviation of one
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %&gt;%
  # PCA is done here
  # Use threshold to specify we want to capture 90% of variance in the data
  step_pca(all_predictors(),
           threshold = 0.9)

# prep() implements the recipe
# bake() applies the PCA model to a dataset
personality_pca &lt;- prep(pca_recipe) %&gt;%
  bake(new_data = pca_data)</code></pre>
<p>That’s it. The PCA is done. (Really!)<br />

<p>He’s reserved, private, guarded, reclusive, confidential, and an introvert. All of these are getting at the same thing. If we already know that Mr. Darcy is <strong>reserved</strong>, do we learn that much more about him if we also know he’s <strong>private</strong>? Not really, right? These two traits tend to go together (if you’re curious, their correlation is 0.909).</p>
<p>Intuitively, <em>all</em> the reserved-type traits go together. So let’s bundle them all together into a single, new variable. Why don’t we call it, oh, I don’t know, a <strong><em>principal component</em></strong>? If we knew what Mr. Darcy’s score was on this new principal component that bundles together reserved, private, etc., we’d still have a pretty good idea of what type of person he is, even though we wouldn’t know his scores for each individual trait. <em>This is what PCA does</em>, except on a larger scale and with math instead of with intuition, as we just did with Mr. Darcy.<br />

<p>I won’t rehash what’s in the graph, so inspect it yourself. But I can imagine characters from some of my favourite books and shows fitting nicely into some of these PCs.</p>
<p>In fact, why don’t we see which characters score highest and lowest among these components?</p>

<p>These are spot-on! Joffrey Baratheon is ludicrous and deranged, Gus Fring is hard and armoured, and Leslie Knope is most definitely obsessed and hurried. Characters on opposite ends of the PCs are spot-on, too, from tiresome, stick-in-the-mud Mr. Collins to refined, manicured Tahani Al-Jamil.<br />
 </p>
<p>We can also combine components to see how they relate to one another. (In fancier terminology, we’re taking a bivariate view instead of a univariate view.) For example, if we plot <code>PC01</code> (deranged vs. resonable) against <code>PC04</code> (rugged vs. refined), we can see where characters fall along both components, resulting in a more nuanced look at their personalities. Characters farther to the right (or left) are more deranged (or reasonable). And characters higher up (or down) are more rugged (or refined).</p>

<p>Taking this view also emphasizes that <strong>a single component can only take you so far</strong>. There isn’t just one type of “deranged” (<code>PC01</code>) character. Adding another component, in this case “rugged vs. refined” (<code>PC04</code>), we see that there are different flavours of deranged. For example, Jayne Cobb (<em>Firefly</em>) and Lucille Bluth (<em>Arrested Development</em>) have approximately the same score on <code>PC01</code>, but very different scores on <code>PC04</code>. I would agree that they’re both deranged, but in very different ways. Adding a third (or fourth! or fifth!) component into the mix would give us even more nuance. (But I won’t do that here, because visualizing more than two continuous dimensions gets tricky.)<br />

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We’ve learned a lot about this dataset by conducting PCA and exploring the results. But dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA are often a precursor to other things, like developing classification models. I also think this dataset is so rich and interesting that you could explore it in other ways that have nothing to do with PCA.</p>
<p>If you’d like to take this analysis further, you can find the data on my <a href="https://github.com/tacookson/data/tree/master/fictional-character-personalities">GitHub repo of interesting datasets</a>. Some areas to look into are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does gender affect how characters are portrayed and perceived?</li>
<li>What are the clusters of personality types? Which characters from different fictional works are most like one another?</li>
<li>Are certain personalities more prominent in certain genres? For example, do sitcoms tend to have personalities that other genres don’t?</li>
</ul>

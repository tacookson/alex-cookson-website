<p>Hi! I’m Alex. I love data science, cycling, and cats.</p>
<p>I currently work at the <a href="https://www.mint.ca/">Royal Canadian Mint</a>, where I help the marketing team make the most of their data. I’ve worked a bunch of machine learning and business analytics projects, including predictive models for customer churn, recommendation engines, and self-service dashboards.</p>
<p>I have Master’s degrees in International Business from HEC Paris and Queen’s University. I also earned my Bachelor’s degree from Queen’s University, where I studied commerce.</p>
<p>Feel free to check out some of my <a href="/post/">posts</a> or check me out on <a href="https://twitter.com/alexcookson">Twitter</a>!</p>

      <description>Have you ever brought a bottle of wine, flowers, or chocolate babka to a dinner party as a host/hostess gift? Or brought home a souvenir for your parents, partner, or kids after you’ve been travelling – like chocolate from Switzerland or, uh… Brazil nuts from Brazil? Countries do the same thing, kind of.
Diplomatic gifts are often exchanged when dignitaries travel abroad or receive visitors. They can be lavish, like a $780,000 emerald and diamond jewellery set, given by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.</description>

      <description>I love musicals! Who doesn’t?! That feeling when the lits dim at the beginning of the show. The intermission conversation (post-bathroom!) of which songs you enjoyed the most. Spending the rest of the week (maybe month?) humming your favourites to the annoyance of everyone around you.
What’s that? Les Misérables is obviously the best musical? I know, I know. I mean, Hamilton is good and all that, and it deserves praise, but it’s no Les Mis (don’t @ me).</description>

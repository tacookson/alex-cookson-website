      <description>In this post, I create a heat map using the Philly Parking Tickets dataset from TidyTuesday. TidyTuesday a project that shares a new dataset each week to give R users a way to apply and practice their skills.
Specifically, we’ll cover:
Cleaning and aggregating the data that will go into our heat mapCreating a basic heat mapTweaking ggplot2 theme components to get a much prettier heat map</description>

      <description>In this post, I look at the Horror movie ratings dataset from TidyTuesday, a project that shares a new dataset each week to give R users a way to apply and practice their skills.
We’re going to run a LASSO regression, a type of regularization. Regularization is often used when you have lots of predictors (compared to your number of observations) or when your data has multi-collinearity – predictors that are highly correlated with one another.</description>

      <description>In this post, I analyze the Powerlifting dataset from TidyTuesday, a project that shares a new dataset each week to give R users a way to apply and practice their skills. This week’s data is about the results of powerlifting events that are part of the International Powerlifting Federation.
SetupFirst, we’ll load our packages, set our default ggplot2 theme, and import our data. We’re loading to packages, in addition to the tidyverse:</description>

      <description>In this post, I analyze the Pizza Party dataset from TidyTuesday, a project that shares a new dataset each week to give R users a way to apply and practice their skills. This week’s data is about survey ratings of New York pizza restaurants.
SetupFirst, let’s load the tidyverse, change our default ggplot2 theme, and load the data. (I named the dataframe pizza_barstool_raw because I’ll probably add some cleaning steps and I like to have the original data on hand.</description>

      <description>In this post, I analyze the National Park Visits dataset from TidyTuesday, a project that shares a new dataset each week to give R users a way to apply and practice their skills. This week’s data is about visitor numbers for US National Parks, going way back to 1904, when there were only six national parks.
I’ve never been to a US national park, but I know about some of the famous ones like Yosemite and Yellowstone.</description>
